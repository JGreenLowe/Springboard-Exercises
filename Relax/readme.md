# Results of Relax User Engagement Analysis

## Executive Summary
Unfortunately, very few of the factors in the database correlated positively with a user's degree of engagement. Users who received the marketing campaign and/or the mail campaign were **less** likely to become an engaged user, and there was no firm trend for users to become more engaged based on the date, day, month, or time during which they first joined as a user. Users who were invited by highly-engaged users were no more likely to become engaged themselves. The only even somewhat notable findings were that users associated with some organizations were more likely to become engaged, and users who joined as a 'personal user' as a guest of another organization were less likely to become engaged. However, these findings were not statistically significant. One apparent error in the data was that every user's final login time was the same as that user's initial login time -- this should be corrected in any future research to allow for more accurate measurement of the effects of time of day on engagement.

## Personal Users Were Less Engaged
As shown in the graph below, users who created an account in order to join another user's personal workspace had only about an 8% chance to become engaged, as compared to an 18-20% chance for users who joined through other methods. This may simply reflect the fact that users joining another user's workspace are using the service as a favor to a friend, rather than based on a long-term professional need. However, out of an abundance of caution, it may be useful to focus marketing efforts *away* from users who joined through another user's personal workspace.

## Some Organizations Had Higher Engagement Levels
As shown in the graph below, some organizations were more likely than others to have their users become engaged. However, the distribution of user engagement by organization roughly follows a bell curve, suggesting that there is nothing out of the ordinary occurring here. It is possible that the organizations on the right-hand-side of this bell curve are somewhat more likely to produce engaged users, but it is more likely that those organizations accumulated additional engaged users through chance alone. By comparing a random sample of 60% of the users to identify organizations that *appear* to have disproportionately engaged users, and then examining the engagement rates of users by organization in the remaining (held out) 40% of the data, I was able to find that there is only a r=0.19 correlation between the engagement levels of an organization across the two samples -- but if organizational culture were truly driving organizational engagemment, then we would expect a much stronger correlation. A correlation at least as strong as the one we observed could arise through chance alone in a sample of this size about 16% of the time.

## Timestamps were Erroneously Duplicated
The timestamps for a user's final login appear to accurately reflect the date of the user's last login, but not the time of the user's last login -- the time is simply being copied over from the user's first login. For example, a user who first logged in on January 2 at 3:45 pm and who last logged in on May 6 at 10:10 pm would appear to have last logged in on May 6 at 3:45 pm. This makes it challenging to draw accurate inferences from the total length of a user's engagement or from the final time at which a user logged out. If either of these variables is likely to affect engagement, then the databae should be repaired to fix this error.
